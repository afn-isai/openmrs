WAR package
--------------------------------
Intended for more advanced users. Our Reference Application war package requires an existing installed Java servlet container such as Apache Tomcat and an existing installed database such as MySQL. The war contains all Reference Application modules, which simplifies the enterprise setup, but has a limitation of not preserving your custom versions of modules in case you upgrade to a newer version of Reference Application.

Zip with modules
--------------------------------
Intended for most advanced users. You must download and install an OpenMRS Platform WAR, which requires an existing Java servlet container such as Apache Tomcat, and an existing database such as MySQL. Next you need to unzip all Reference Application modules into the OpenMRS Application Data directory. Please see https://wiki.openmrs.org/display/docs/Installing+OpenMRS+2.x for more detailed instructions.
